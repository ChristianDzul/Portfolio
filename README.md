# Portfolio WEB-DEVELOPMENT 2024

This repository is home to my personal web development portfolio project. As a budding web developer, I am using this space to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and potentially other web technologies. Here, you'll find a collection of mini-projects, each highlighting different aspects of web design and front-end development.

The primary goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my abilities to create responsive, visually appealing websites. Each project within this repository is designed to reflect my understanding of modern web development practices and my ability to implement them effectively.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements!
